Alissa (she/they) is a postdoctoral researcher at DIKU and affiliated with NRU and Queer in AI. Their research interests include exploring how current psychiatric frameworks benefit some patients more than others, with interests in using AI to create more equitable psychiatric practices (otherwise referred to as 'precision psychiatry').

Their previous work used electronic health record (EHR) data in NYC to characterize diagnostic disparities in schizophrenia diagnoses impacting racial/ethinic groups and LGBTQ+ patients. Using natural language processing methods, their work quantified patient exposure to clinician bias, showing that increased exposure is associated with increased odds of obtaining a schizophrenia diagnosis in the Mount Sinai Health System emergency department.
